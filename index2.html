          <h5 class="card-title">About Me</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I am an avid gamer in my spare time. In my exploration of games and puzzles, I have come to find computer science as a kind of marriage of my two favorite interests. I am currently going to Oregon State University-Cascades in pursuit of a degree in computer science. Even though I am new and learning I am enjoying my experience so far and I am excited to find the limits of my ability and learn how to play inside those limits to learn how to expand them comfortably.</p>
